# 01: Simple Calculator 🧮

A robust Command Line Interface (CLI) calculator built with Python. This project focuses on implementing core programming logic, user input handling, and basic error prevention.

## 🚀 Features
* **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* **Continuous Loop:** Allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters valid numbers.

## 🛠️ Logic Explained
In this project, I used:
1. **Functions:** To keep the code modular and reusable.
2. **While Loops:** To create an interactive user experience.
3. **If-Else Blocks:** To route user choices to the correct mathematical operation.

## 📋 How to Run
1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd 01_Simple_Calculator

python calculator.py
